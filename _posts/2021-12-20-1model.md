In order to inform the passengers and operators of the potential delay before the event, we also developed a prediction model, and this section will go through its features and the overall methodology. To begin, we decided to consider the train delay issue as a **classification problem (perceived delay or not)**, rather than a linear regression of the delay minutes. From the practical perspective, the passengers don't really feel the difference between 10 min late and 11 min late, but we believe they would be concerned if the delay duration is perceptible, which in this project is **greater than 5 minutes**.

In order to inform the passengers and operators of the potential delay before the event, we also developed a prediction model, and this section will go through its features and the overall methodology. To begin, we decided to consider the train delay issue as a **classification problem (perceived delay or not)**, rather than a linear regression of the delay minutes. From the practical perspective, the passengers don't really feel the difference between 10 min late and 11 min late, but we believe they would be concerned if the delay duration is perceptible, which in this project is **greater than 5 minutes** (30% of the dataset).

## 2. Model

After the feature engineering, we scaled the numeric variables and transformed the categorical variables to one-hot features. The model used 2019/11 and 2019/12 delay data, and randomly divided them into 7:3 as train dataset and test dataset correspondingly. The train dataset is used to train the model and the test dataset is used to evaluate model fitness and generalization. We also run a `RandomForestClassifier` model based on features and perform cross validation in train model to adjust hyperparameter. The accuracy in train dataset is about 98.7%,  while for the test set, the accuracy is about **74.9%** which is slightly higher than random guessing all trips will not be delayed for more than 5mins ( because in the original dataset, 30% of the trips were delayed for more than 5min). 

When it comes to confusion matrix, we can clearly see that our model have **good specificity (44.5%) and high sensitivity(88.2%)**. Considering the train delay can impose high cost in transportation system and personal activity, the specificity which indicate the model can predict the delayed train correctly in 44.5% of time and thus has great significance in reality.  The sensitivity indicates that the model can predict the non-delayed train correctly in 88.2% of time.  Both of them suggest our model has good fitness and generalization.

Here is the importance of the features, it indicates that station lag, weather, and stop sequence realated variables are the most important features in this model.

## 3. Next Step
There are several aspects that the model can be improved in the future. Firstly, we may want to focus on the time lag feature, which means the delay minutes of the previous train on the same station.

Secondly, BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15019801">(2011)</a>, Siddharth <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-20-of-your-trains-are-always-late/articleshow/64640066.cms">(2018)</a>,  Brad <a href="https://bradwarden.com/japan/traindelay/">(2020)</a>, shared some insight about the potential reasons that impact the trainâ€™s punctuality in the UK, India, Japan correspondingly. Except for time and spatially related features, main causes such as engineering work (e.g. train inspection or track renewal), technical issues (e.g. signal failure or track fractures) also have an effect on the train's punctuality. Higgs <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2021/07/breakdowns-now-the-top-cause-for-canceled-nj-transit-trains-neglect-and-underfunding-to-blame.html">(2021)</a> also mentioned that breakdown is the top cause of  NJ Transit's cancellation. Therefore, we believe that such kinds of maintenance and breakdown notification, for example from <a href="https://twitter.com/NJTRANSIT_NEC">an official Twitter account</a>,  can be incorporated into this model in the future.

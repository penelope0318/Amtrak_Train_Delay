## 0. Data Preparation
Here is a glimpse of the original dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pranavbadami/nj-transit-amtrak-nec-performance?select=2018_11.csv">Kaggle</a>. We selected the data in 11/2019 and 12/2019, totaling 682,163 rows. To clean the data, we dropped any rows with NA values in the `scheduled_time`, `delay_minutes`, `from_id`, `to_id` columns. Additionally, in order to focus on the issue of punctuality , we decided to drop any records labelled as `cancelation`, as this is distinct from the issue of delay in some extent. The final cleaned dataset has 436,100 records in total. To gain a geographical perspective on the delay, the dataset was combined with the stations' location data from <a href="https://github.com/pranavbadami/njtransit">Pranav Badami</a>. 



## 1. Statistic Summary 

These histograms illustrate the substantially left-skewed distribution of train delays in NJ transit's commute rail services in 2019 November and December. The bulk of the delay (97% ）events was spaned from **0 min to 20 min**, however, there is an extremely long tail in the data, which reveals that approximately 50 travels (0.016%) are suffering from more than 100 minutes delay.

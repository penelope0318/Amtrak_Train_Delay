## 0. Data Preparation
Here is the glimpse of the original dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pranavbadami/nj-transit-amtrak-nec-performance?select=2018_11.csv">Kaggle</a>. We selected the data in 11/2019 and 12/2019, totalling 682,163 rows. As for data cleaning we dropped all rows with NA in scheduled_time, delay_minutes, from_id, to_id columns. Becides, in order to focus on the punctuality issue, we decides to drop all records that marked as 'cancelation', as it is a bit different from delay. 

## 1. Statistic Summary 

These histograms illustrate the substantially left-skewed distribution of train delays in NJ transit's commute rail services in 2019 November and December. The bulk of the delay (97% ï¼‰events was spaned from **0 min to 20 min**, however, there is an extremely long tail in the data, which reveals that approximately 50 travels (0.016%) are suffering from more than 100 minutes delay.
